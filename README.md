>- Classification **Accuracy** = (***TP+TN***) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
>- Misclassification rate (**Error Rate**) = (***FP + FN***) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
>- **Precision** = TP/Total TRUE Predictions = ***TP***/ (TP+FP) (When model predicted TRUE class, how often was it right?)
>- **Recall** = TP/ Actual TRUE = ***TP***/ (TP+FN) (when the class was actually TRUE, how often did the classifier get it right?)
